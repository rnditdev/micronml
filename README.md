A low resource, portable, embeddable C Machine Learning library

Main features:
* Only dependent on BLAS
* Should work on many architectures, from Cray supercomputesr to embedded arm processors and GPUs.
Candidate architecture: x86, x64, PowerPC, Cuda cards, ATI cards via clBlas, ARM, NEC SX-4, SPARC, Cray X1.
* Able to run in memory and disk space restricted setups

This is a project on research phase, we are lloking for interested parties and ideas, bring your own on comments, thanks!
